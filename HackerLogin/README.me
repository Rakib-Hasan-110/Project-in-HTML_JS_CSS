This project features a Hacker-themed Login Page designed using HTML and CSS. The layout and design reflect a modern, edgy aesthetic, reminiscent of a hackerâ€™s interface. It incorporates a red and black color scheme for a dark and mysterious vibe, which is often associated with hacking culture. The login page includes interactive hover effects that enhance the user experience, with elements turning red upon hovering, creating an exciting and dynamic feel.

Key Features: Red and Black Theme: The background uses a striking red-black combination, creating a bold contrast and enhancing the hacker-like theme. Hover Effects: All interactive elements (like buttons and form fields) change to a glowing red when hovered, adding a dynamic visual effect to the page. Form Input Design: The login form is simple yet stylized with clean, sharp borders and easy-to-use input fields. Dangerous Look and Feel: The design is intentionally dramatic and menacing, giving the page an intense and edgy vibe.

Technologies Used: HTML: For creating the structure of the login page. CSS: For styling the page, creating hover effects, and setting the color theme.
